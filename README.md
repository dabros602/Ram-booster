# Ram-booster
Boost your ram by moving less important processes to hard drive



## What it does?
Ram booster tells your OS that some processes are useless on RAM so it moves it to virtual memory or a segment of your hard drive dedicated to processes that don't need your RAM's speed



## How to setup?
Download the ZIP and extract then run rambooster.exe to start, if it says "Windows protected your PC" click "More Info" then "Run Anyway".

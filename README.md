# Ram-booster
Boost your ram by moving less important processes to hard drive



## What it does?
Ram booster tells your OS that some processes are useless on RAM so it moves it to virtual memory or a segment of your hard drive dedicated to processes that don't need your RAM's speed



## How to setup?
Download the ZIP and extract then run rambooster.exe to start, if it says "Windows protected your PC" click "More Info" then "Run Anyway". Optionally press Windows+R then type shell:startup and press enter. Make a new shortcut with the path being the path to rambooster.exe on your computer. This will make it run on startup
